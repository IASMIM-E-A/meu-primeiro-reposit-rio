    <p class="meu paragrafo">I've been hearing symphonies
        Before, all I heard was silence
        A rhapsody for you and me
        And every melody is timeless
        Life was stringing me along
        Then you came and you cut me loose
        Was solo, singing on my own
        Now I can't find the key without you
        And now your song is on repeat
        And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
        And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
        So, if you want the truth
        I just wanna be part of your symphony
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        Symphony
        Like a love song on the radio
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        I'm sorry if it's all too much
        Every day you're here, I'm healing
        And I was runnin' out of luck
        I never thought I'd find this feeling
        'Cause I've been hearing symphonies
        Before all I heard was silence
        A rhapsody for you and me
        (A rhapsody for you and me)
        And every melody is timeless
        And now your song is on repeat
        And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
        And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
        So, if you want the truth
        I just wanna be part of your symphony
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        Symphony
        Like a love song on the radio
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
        Ah ah, ah
        Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
        Ah ah, ah
        And now your song is on repeat
        And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
        And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
        So, if you want the truth (oh)
        I just wanna be part of your symphony
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        Symphony
        Like a love song on the radio
        Symphony
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?
        Symphony
        Like a love song on the radio
        Will you hold me tight and not let go?</p>
